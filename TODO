!!!!FINAL TODO
Testing:
- more unit tests by manually feeding in the string
- some form of prop based testing with some of these 
- generate the AST and print that out and add some space in the middle there and parse that in 
make sure that we have the same values for everything there
- test cases are a big deal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- make em work forreal

To complete:
- option for creating second pane, split vertically
- click button to show graph - for this we need to store the old cpu and memory history to ensure that shows up


really get testing up


have some initial setup where they ask us what we want to see onboarding 

get the interface setup to make things work
